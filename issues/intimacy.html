                    <h2>The Desire Dilemma</h2>
                    <p>Sexual desire problems are among the most common—and most distressing—issues couples face. One partner wants more sex, the other wants less, and both feel hurt, rejected, or inadequate. Traditional advice often focuses on scheduling sex, trying new things, or addressing "responsive desire." But these solutions rarely work for long.</p>
                    <p>Crucible Therapy takes a radically different view: <strong>desire problems in long-term relationships are normal and necessary.</strong> They're not a sign that something is wrong with you or your marriage. They're a sign that your relationship is pushing you to grow.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Why Desire Fades</h2>
                    <p>In the early stages of a relationship, desire often comes easily. You're discovering each other, the novelty is exciting, and you haven't yet bumped up against each other's limitations. But as relationships mature, something changes.</p>
                    <p>The conventional explanation is that familiarity breeds boredom. Crucible Therapy sees it differently: <strong>intimacy—real intimacy—is threatening.</strong> As you get closer, you become more known. And being truly known is terrifying.</p>
                    <p>Many people unconsciously shut down desire to avoid the vulnerability of being fully seen during sex. It's easier to "not be in the mood" than to show up fully and risk rejection, judgment, or exposure of parts of yourself you'd rather hide.</p>

                    <h2>The Low Desire Partner Controls Sex</h2>
                    <p>One of Dr. Schnarch's key insights is that in any relationship, <strong>there's always a high desire partner and a low desire partner, and the low desire partner always controls sex.</strong></p>
                    <p>This isn't about libido—it's about whoever wants less of something at any given time. The person who wants less controls when, whether, and how sex happens. Understanding this dynamic is crucial because it reveals the hidden power structures in sexual relationships.</p>
                    <p>Both positions have their challenges. High desire partners often feel rejected and desperate. Low desire partners often feel pressured and resentful. Neither position is inherently better or worse—they're just different ways of managing the anxiety of intimacy.</p>

                    <h2>The Path to Passionate Marriage</h2>
                    <p>Crucible Therapy doesn't try to increase desire through techniques or novelty. Instead, it helps couples develop the differentiation necessary for truly intimate sex.</p>
                    <p>This means developing the capacity to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Be fully present during sex rather than mentally checking out</li>
                        <li>Let yourself be seen—including the parts you find shameful</li>
                        <li>Tolerate the anxiety of real intimacy without shutting down</li>
                        <li>Want your partner out of desire, not obligation</li>
                        <li>Maintain your sense of self even in moments of intense connection</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Sex as a Window to the Soul</h2>
                    <p>Dr. Schnarch famously said that sex is a window into everything else in your relationship. How you handle desire, rejection, vulnerability, and connection in bed mirrors how you handle these things everywhere else.</p>
                    <p>This is why improving your sex life isn't really about sex—it's about becoming a more developed person. As you grow in your capacity for intimacy, your capacity for passionate sex grows too.</p>
                    <p>The couples who develop the deepest sexual connection aren't the ones with the highest libidos or the best techniques. They're the ones who have done the work to become people who can handle real intimacy—in all its terrifying, exhilarating, vulnerable glory.</p>
