                    <h2>The Devastation of Betrayal</h2>
                    <p>Few things shatter a relationship like infidelity. The discovery of an affair often feels like the end of everything—the end of trust, the end of the marriage as you knew it, the end of your sense of reality. Everything you believed about your relationship suddenly comes into question.</p>
                    <p>Whether you're the one who was betrayed or the one who strayed, the aftermath of infidelity is one of the most painful experiences a couple can face. And yet, Crucible Therapy offers a perspective that many find surprising: <strong>affairs, as devastating as they are, can become a catalyst for profound growth—both individual and relational.</strong></p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Why Affairs Happen</h2>
                    <p>Traditional explanations for affairs often focus on what was "missing" in the marriage—not enough attention, not enough sex, not enough appreciation. While these factors can play a role, Crucible Therapy looks deeper.</p>
                    <p>Affairs often happen when one or both partners lack the differentiation to handle the normal challenges of intimacy. Rather than confronting difficult truths, addressing unmet needs directly, or tolerating the anxiety of authentic self-expression, it can feel easier to find validation elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>This isn't about excusing the affair—it's about understanding it. Without this understanding, couples often find themselves stuck in cycles of blame and shame that prevent real healing.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>The Crucible Approach to Healing</h2>
                    <p>Many approaches to affair recovery focus on the betrayed partner's need for reassurance and the unfaithful partner's need to demonstrate remorse. While these have their place, Crucible Therapy recognizes that this approach often keeps couples stuck.</p>
                    <p>When the betrayed partner's healing depends entirely on the other's behavior, they remain vulnerable. When the unfaithful partner's identity becomes defined by their transgression, growth becomes impossible.</p>
                    <p>Instead, Crucible Therapy helps both partners develop the capacity to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Face painful truths about themselves and the marriage</li>
                        <li>Self-soothe rather than depending on the other for emotional regulation</li>
                        <li>Hold onto themselves while remaining engaged with their partner</li>
                        <li>Make choices based on their own integrity rather than fear or guilt</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Rebuilding on a New Foundation</h2>
                    <p>The goal isn't to return to the marriage you had before—that marriage had vulnerabilities that contributed to the affair. The goal is to build something stronger.</p>
                    <p>This requires both partners to grow. The unfaithful partner must develop the courage to be honest and the integrity to align their actions with their values. The betrayed partner must develop the strength to not be defined by their partner's choices and the wisdom to see their partner—and themselves—clearly.</p>
                    <p>It's painful work. But couples who navigate this process often emerge with a relationship that is more honest, more intimate, and more resilient than what they had before. The affair becomes not the end of their story, but a turning point.</p>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Is Recovery Possible?</h2>
                    <p>Not every marriage survives infidelity, and not every marriage should. But for couples willing to do the work, recovery is possible—not despite the difficulty, but through it.</p>
                    <p>The same capacity for growth that Crucible Therapy develops—the ability to hold onto yourself while staying connected, to tolerate discomfort in service of something meaningful, to be honest even when it's hard—these are exactly what's needed to heal from betrayal.</p>
                    <p>Whether you stay together or not, developing these capacities will serve you. You'll become someone who can handle life's inevitable difficulties with more grace, more integrity, and more resilience.</p>
