                    <h2>The Communication Myth</h2>
                    <p>Most couples who come to therapy believe their problem is communication. "If only we could communicate better," they say. "If only my partner would listen." Traditional therapy often responds by teaching communication skills: use "I" statements, reflect back what you heard, avoid criticism.</p>
                    <p>But here's what Crucible Therapy understands that most approaches miss: <strong>most couples communicate quite well—they just don't like what they're hearing.</strong></p>
                    <p>Think about it. The same person who "can't communicate" with their spouse often communicates perfectly fine with coworkers, friends, and strangers. The problem isn't a lack of skill. It's that intimate conversations trigger anxiety, and when we're anxious, we stop communicating effectively.</p>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Why Communication Breaks Down</h2>
                    <p>In Crucible Therapy, we understand that communication problems are usually symptoms of a deeper issue: <strong>difficulty maintaining a solid sense of self when emotionally engaged with your partner.</strong></p>
                    <p>When you feel threatened—when you sense criticism, rejection, or the possibility that you might be wrong—your nervous system activates. Blood flows away from your brain's executive functions toward your survival circuits. You literally become less capable of thinking clearly, listening well, and responding thoughtfully.</p>
                    <p>This is why couples have the same argument over and over. It's not that they haven't explained themselves clearly enough. It's that neither person can tolerate the anxiety of truly hearing the other.</p>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>The Real Solution</h2>
                    <p>Rather than teaching you better communication techniques, Crucible Therapy helps you develop the capacity to <strong>stay calm and clear even when your partner is saying things you don't want to hear.</strong></p>
                    <p>This means developing what Dr. Schnarch called "differentiation"—the ability to hold onto yourself while staying emotionally connected to your partner. When you're well-differentiated, you can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listen to your partner's perspective without feeling threatened</li>
                        <li>Share your truth without needing your partner to agree</li>
                        <li>Stay present during difficult conversations instead of shutting down or escalating</li>
                        <li>Tolerate the discomfort of disagreement without losing yourself</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>A Different Kind of Conversation</h2>
                    <p>When both partners develop greater differentiation, communication transforms naturally. You don't need special techniques because you're no longer hijacked by anxiety. You can actually hear what your partner is saying because you're not so busy defending yourself.</p>
                    <p>The irony is that when you stop needing your partner to validate you, you become capable of much deeper communication. You can share the parts of yourself you've been hiding. You can hear feedback without crumbling. You can have the honest conversations that intimacy requires.</p>
                    <p>Communication isn't about finding the right words. It's about becoming the kind of person who can handle real conversations.</p>
