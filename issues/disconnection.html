                    <h2>The Slow Drift Apart</h2>
                    <p>It rarely happens overnight. One day you look up and realize you and your partner have become strangers sharing a house. You manage logistics, divide responsibilities, maybe raise children together—but the spark, the intimacy, the sense that you're truly partners? Gone.</p>
                    <p>This kind of disconnection is incredibly common, and incredibly painful. You might not even be fighting. On the surface, everything seems "fine." But underneath, there's an emptiness where your relationship used to be.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>How It Happens</h2>
                    <p>Conventional wisdom says couples drift apart when they stop putting in effort—when date nights end, when conversations become logistical, when life gets in the way. There's some truth to this, but Crucible Therapy sees a deeper pattern.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disconnection is often a protection against the anxiety of real connection.</strong> At some point, being truly intimate with your partner felt risky. Maybe you got hurt. Maybe you showed yourself and felt rejected. Maybe the demands of genuine intimacy felt like too much.</p>
                    <p>So you withdrew. Not dramatically—you didn't leave or have affairs. You just... pulled back. You stopped sharing your inner life. You stopped being curious about theirs. You created enough distance to feel safe.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>The Safety of Distance</h2>
                    <p>Here's the paradox: the distance that feels so empty is also providing something. It's protecting you from the vulnerability of being known. It's shielding you from potential rejection. It's allowing you to maintain a version of yourself that hasn't been tested against your partner's actual responses.</p>
                    <p>Many couples unconsciously collude in maintaining this distance. As long as neither person pushes for more, both can feel relatively comfortable—even while feeling profoundly lonely.</p>
                    <p>Breaking this pattern requires courage. It means being willing to show up again, to reveal yourself again, to risk rejection again. It means choosing intimacy over comfort.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Reconnection Requires Self-Confrontation</h2>
                    <p>The path back to connection doesn't start with your partner—it starts with yourself. Crucible Therapy asks you to look honestly at your own role in the disconnection. Not to blame yourself, but to reclaim your power.</p>
                    <p>Questions to consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are you avoiding by staying distant?</li>
                        <li>What would you have to face if you truly showed up in your marriage?</li>
                        <li>What parts of yourself have you been hiding?</li>
                        <li>What would it mean to want your partner—not just need them for logistics or parenting, but actually want them?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These questions aren't comfortable. But they point toward the growth that reconnection requires.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>The Risk of Reaching</h2>
                    <p>Reconnection means taking initiative—not waiting for your partner to make the first move. It means being willing to be the one who reaches out, who shows up, who risks rejection.</p>
                    <p>This is terrifying for most people. What if you reach out and they don't respond? What if you show yourself and they don't care? What if the disconnection is permanent?</p>
                    <p>Crucible Therapy doesn't promise that reaching out will be met with the response you want. Your partner might not be ready. They might not respond. The relationship might not survive.</p>
                    <p>But here's what's also true: <strong>you'll never know what's possible until you try.</strong> And regardless of how your partner responds, becoming someone who can reach out—who can show up, be vulnerable, and handle whatever comes—that growth belongs to you.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="chapter-summary">
                    <h2>Beyond Reconnection</h2>
                    <p>The goal isn't just to feel close again. It's to develop the capacity for a different kind of closeness—one that doesn't depend on your partner doing everything right, one that can weather disagreement and disappointment, one that's based on two solid selves choosing each other rather than two incomplete people desperately needing each other.</p>
                    <p>This kind of connection is harder to achieve and easier to lose track of. It requires ongoing attention and courage. But it's also more resilient, more satisfying, and more real than the fusion that many couples mistake for intimacy.</p>
                    <p>The disconnection you're experiencing isn't the end of your story. It might be the beginning of something deeper—if you're willing to do the work.</p>
